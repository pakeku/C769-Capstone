### Steps:

#### 1\. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project:

-   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
-   Create a new project or select an existing one.

#### 2\. Enable Google APIs:

-   Enable the Google Drive API for your project in the GCP console.
-   Additionally, you may need to enable the Google OAuth API if you haven't already.

#### 3\. Set Up OAuth Consent Screen:

-   Configure the OAuth consent screen in your GCP project. Add necessary details like the app name, logo, scopes, etc.

#### 4\. Obtain OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Secret:

-   Generate OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) for your web application in the GCP console.
-   Set the authorized redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/callback`) where Google will redirect after authentication.

#### 5\. Implement Google Sign-In in React:

-   Use the Google Sign-In library for JavaScript to initiate the OAuth flow in your React app.
-   Install the library:

    bashCopy code

    `npm install react-google-login`

-   Implement the login button and handle authentication using the library.

#### 6\. Obtain Access Token and Use Google Drive API:

-   After successful authentication, you'll receive an access token.
-   Use this token to make requests to the Google Drive API. For example, to list files or perform other operations.

#### Important Notes:

-   Store sensitive information like Client ID and Secret securely, preferably using environment variables.
-   Ensure you handle tokens securely and make requests to the Google API server-side to prevent exposing credentials.
